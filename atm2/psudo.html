                <h1>The goal</h1>
                <p>The goal is to make a working atm that has 2 accounts you can access, Checking and Savings.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-6">
                <h1>The process</h1>
                <ul>
                    <ol>First i need to create a basic functioning design</ol>
                    <ol>Now i need to find a way to make a working keypad to input the pin. I also dont want people to be able to use the numbers on the keyboard for the inputs.</ol>
                    <ol>I need to create an object that stores the user information. For now i will make it card number 1111 and pin 1111 for fast testing.</ol>
                    <ol>I need to create a function that compares the pin and card number. If they are the same i want it to display the main screen.</ol>
                    <ol>The main screen will tell the user hello so i need to loop through the objects and grab the first and last name of the user and set those to a variable. I will call it a session variable.</ol>
                    <ol>The main screen will ask the user if they want to deposit withdrawl transfer change pin or check balance</ol>
                    <ol>If the user chooses deposit, withdrawl or transfer it will ask the user if they want to do checking or savings</ol>
                    <ol>It would be cool to have an animation for money coming out of the atm </ol>
                    <ol>If the user chooses to change pin compare the pin input to current pin and get them to input the pin twice. if both pins match the new pin gets saved in the object</ol>
                    <ol>If the user chooses to check balance ask if they want to check their checking balance or their savings balance. depending on what they want to check print a recpit reflecting the balance.</ol>
