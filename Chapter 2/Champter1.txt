Short Answer
1. Why is the CPU the most important component in a computer? It processes all of the user inputs and programs
2. What number does a bit that is turned on represent? What number does a bit that
is turned off represent? bit that is turned off is 0 bit that is turned on is 1
3. What would you call a device that works with binary data? A computer
4. What are the words that make up a high-level programming language called? key words
5. What are the short words that are used in assembly language called? mnemonic
6. What is the difference between a compiler and an interpreter? Compliler converts to machine code and then outputs where as the interpreter doesnt have to turn the code into machine code it just outputs
7. What type of software controls the internal operations of the computer’s hardware? Operating System
